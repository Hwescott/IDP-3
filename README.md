# Calculator Project


I wanted to do a few different things with this project:

* First I wanted to use the html and css to help build off of what I already now about js
* I also wanted to build something interacitve that would be helpful in everyday life
* I am still working on completing the actual working ability of the calculator, but for now I am happy with how it looks.
